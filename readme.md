# Anagram Maker

A small script to create anagrams.

## To Use

Instructions:

    1. Create a file in the same directory as the script, calling this file "plaintext.txt".
    2. On each line of this file, type a phase that you would like converting to an anagram.
    3. Save the file and run the script.
    4. Your anagrams will be in the newly created file "anagrams.txt".

## Anagram Rules

This script takes all letters in a given phrase and jumbles them throughout the whole phrase.
All spaces in the phrase are kept in the correct place within the phrase but letters may move between words.
For example, the phrase "a test" might be reformatted to "e tsat".
